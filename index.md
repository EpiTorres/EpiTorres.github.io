# About Me
Hi there! My name is Epifanio Torres, but you can call me Epi! I just graduated from Princeton University as part of the Great Class of 2022. During my studies at Princeton, I majored in computer science and minored in Spanish Language and Culture. 

## How I Got Started
Going into college, I had no idea what I wanted to study (or really what I wanted to do with my life). Even though I enjoyed using computers and playing PC games, I had no programming experience prior to starting my studies at Princeton. Deciding that I wanted to give programming a whirl, I signed up for Princeton's introductory computer science class during my first semester. As I worked on <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos126/assignments/nbody/" target="_blank">simulating graviational forces</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos126/assignments/guitar-hero/" target="_blank">programming a virtual guitar</a> as part of this class, I began to realize how much computer science fascinated me. 

The summer after my first year of college, I was chosen to participate in [Princeton Summer Programming Experiences](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/academics/ugradpgm/spe/home/), which focused on providing learning opportunities for students who were new to computer science. By the end of the six-week program, I had codeveloped a [3D video game](https://thisstillwill.itch.io/lucid) and felt extremely proud of how much my programming skills had improved. Not too long afterwards, I decided to major in computer science to continue making cool applications, like video games and websites!
